I created a flashcards project website where users can create their account and then once they have active account, they can create their own flashcards with words and additonal information. There is a main page, where all the cards are fetched, and there is page where cards are filtered by user. Registering and logging in features are also present. Update of the profile is also present where users can edit their username. The dependencies I used are: express ejs body-parser nodemon  jsonwebtoken bcrypt dotenv. The project structure is the same as in coursework description with controllers, service and routes way of structuring project. with public folder for styling and views for html templates.
